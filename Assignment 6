## Running the Program
To run this program:
1.	Save the code in a file with a .py extension, for example, hello.py.
2.	Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.	Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.	Run the program by typing python hello.py (or python3 hello.py on macOS and Linux if you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed).

When you run the program, it will output:
Hello, World!


### List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

## Here are the primary python data types:

a)	Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without a fractional component. Examples: 1, 3, -5.
b)	Floating-Point Number (float): Represents numbers with a fractional component. Examples: 3.14, 0.001, -7.8.
c)	String (str): Represents a sequence of characters. Strings can be enclosed in single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or """). Examples: "hello", 'world'.
d)	Boolean (bool): Represents True or False. Used for conditional logic.

## Here is a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:
# Integer
age = 16
print("age")

# Float
Const pi = 3.14159
print("pi")

# String
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print("greeting")

# Boolean
is_student = True
print("is student:")

### Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.

Conditional statements and loops are fundamental control flow tools in Python, allowing you to execute code based on certain conditions or to repeat code multiple times.
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The most common conditional statement is the if statement.
## if-else Statement
An if-else statement evaluates a condition and executes the corresponding block of code depending on whether the condition is True or False.
Syntax:
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # code to execute if condition is False
Example:
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
In this example, the if statement checks if the variable age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, the program prints "You are an adult." Otherwise, it prints "You are a minor."
# elif Statement
You can use elif (short for "else if") to check multiple conditions.
Copy code
if condition1:
    # code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
    # code to execute if all conditions are False
Example:
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
In this example, the program evaluates the score and prints the corresponding grade.
# Loops
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The most common loops in Python are for loops and while loops.
for Loop
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range).
Syntax:
for item in sequence:
    # code to execute for each item
Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
In this example, the for loop iterates over each element in the list fruits and prints it.
# while Loop
A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.
Syntax:
while condition:
    // code to execute as long as condition is True
Example:
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
In this example, the while loop prints the value of count and then increments it by 1. The loop continues as long as count is less than 5.

Examples of if-else Statement and for Loop
Example of if-else Statement:
number = 10

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
In this example, the if statement checks if the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is even). If the condition is True, it prints "The number is even." Otherwise, it prints "The number is odd."
Example of for Loop:
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

for name in names:
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

### What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses (which may include parameters), and a colon. 

## Why Functions Are Useful
Code Reusability: Functions allow you to write a piece of code once and use it multiple times, which reduces redundancy and makes your code more modular.
Modularity: By breaking your code into smaller, manageable functions, you make it easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
Abstraction: Functions help you encapsulate complexity by providing a simple interface to perform complex tasks.
Scope: Functions help manage variable scope, reducing the likelihood of variable conflicts and unintended side effects.
Defining a Function

## Here's how to define a simple function in Python that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
## Example of Calling the Function
To call the function add_numbers, you need to pass two arguments. Here's an example:

# Define the function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Call the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)

### Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
## Lists:

a)	Ordered: Lists maintain the order of items. The items can be accessed by their index.
b)	Mutable: Lists can be modified after their creation. You can add, remove, or change items.
c)	Elements: Lists can contain any type of elements (integers, strings, other lists, etc.).
## Dictionaries:

a)	Unordered: Dictionaries do not maintain the order of items (though as of Python 3.7, they maintain insertion order for consistency).
b)	Mutable: Dictionaries can be modified after their creation. You can add, remove, or change key-value pairs.
c)	Key-Value Pairs: Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, or tuples), while values can be of any type.
## Example Script
Here is a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with key-value pairs, and demonstrates basic operations on both:

# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    "name": "Tobias",
    "age": 24,
    "city": "Mombasa"
}

# Basic operations on the list
print("Original list:", numbers)

# Adding an element to the list
numbers.append(6)
print("After appending 6:", numbers)

# Removing an element from the list
numbers.remove(3)
print("After removing 3:", numbers)

# Accessing an element by index
print("Element at index 2:", numbers[2])

# Basic operations on the dictionary
print("\nOriginal dictionary:", person)

# Adding a new key-value pair
person["job"] = "Teacher"
print("After adding job:", person)

# Modifying an existing value
person["age"] = 21
print("After modifying age:", person)

# Removing a key-value pair
del person["city"]
print("After removing city:", person)

# Accessing a value by key
print("Name:", person["name"])

### What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors, allowing your program to continue executing even when an error occurs. It provides a way to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program. The main keywords used in exception handling are try, except, else, and finally.

try Block: Contains the code that might raise an exception.
except Block: Contains code that handles the exception. You can specify different types of exceptions to handle different errors.
else Block (optional): Contains code that runs if no exceptions are raised in the try block.
finally Block (optional): Contains code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions.

## Example Script
Here is a Python script that demonstrates how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors:
def divide_numbers(num1, num2):

    try:
        # Attempt to divide the numbers
        result = num1 / num2
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        # Handle division by zero error
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
        print("Exception message:", e)
        return None
    except TypeError as e:
        # Handle type errors (e.g., non-numeric inputs)
        print("Error: Invalid input type!")
        print("Exception message:", e)
        return None

    else:

        # Code to execute if no exceptions occur
        print("Division successful!")
        return result

    finally:
        # Code that always runs
        print("Execution complete.")

# Examples
print("Example 1:")
result1 = divide_numbers(10, 2)  # Valid operation
print("Result:", result1)

print("\nExample 2:")
result2 = divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Division by zero error

print("\nExample 3:")
result3 = divide_numbers(10, "a")  # Invalid input type error

Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.
A module in Python is a file containing Python code. This file can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code.
Modules help organize code into separate files, making it more manageable and reusable.
The file name of a module must end with .py.

A package is a collection of Python modules organized in a directory hierarchy.
Packages allow you to group related modules together. A package is simply a directory that contains a special __init__.py file (which can be empty) and other module files.
Packages enable the organization of complex applications by structuring modules into subdirectories.

## Importing and Using Modules
To use a module in your script, you need to import it. Python provides several ways to import modules, depending on your needs.

a)	Basic Import
You can import an entire module using the import statement:
import module_name
You can then use functions, classes, or variables from the module with the syntax module_name.item.

b)	Import with Alias
You can import a module and give it an alias using the as keyword:
import module_name as alias
This allows you to use a shorter name for the module.

c)	Import Specific Items
You can import specific functions, classes, or variables from a module:

from module_name import item1, item2
You can use item1 and item2 directly without prefixing them with the module name.

## Example Using the math Module
The math module provides mathematical functions and constants. Here's how you can import and use it:

import math

# Using functions from the math module
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))          # Prints: Square root of 16: 4.0
print("Value of pi:", math.pi)                       # Prints: Value of pi: 3.141592653589793

# Using the math module with alias
import math as m
print("Cosine of 0 radians:", m.cos(0))             # Prints: Cosine of 0 radians: 1.0

# Importing specific functions from the math module
from math import factorial, pow
print("Factorial of 5:", factorial(5))              # Prints: Factorial of 5: 120
print("2 raised to the power 3:", pow(2, 3))        # Prints: 2 raised to the power 3: 8.0

### How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from and writing to files are common tasks in programming. Python provides built-in functions to handle these operations.
## Reading from a File
To read from a file in Python, you use the built-in open() function with the file mode 'r' (read mode). Hereâ€™s a simple script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console:

# Reading from a file
def read_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            print("File content:")
            print(content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' does not exist.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: An I/O error occurred while reading the file '{filename}'.")

# Example usage
read_file('example.txt')
## Writing to a File
To write to a file, you use the open() function with the file mode 'w' (write mode) or 'a' (append mode). Hereâ€™s a script that writes a list of strings to a file:
# Writing to a file
def write_to_file(filename, lines):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            for line in lines:
                file.write(line + '\n')
        print(f"Data successfully written to '{filename}'.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: An I/O error occurred while writing to the file '{filename}'.")

# Example usage
lines_to_write = [
    "This is the first line.",
    "This is the second line.",
    "This is the third line."
]
write_to_file('output.txt', lines_to_write)
